## Occult and Mystical Significance of Numbers

According to **William W. Westcott** in *Numbers, Their Occult Power and Mystic Virtues*, numbers possess profound **occult and kabbalistic significance**, functioning as **divine archetypes** that reflect the fundamental structure and principles of the universe.

Drawing from **Pythagorean** and **Kabbalistic** traditions, Westcott emphasizes that numbers are far more than mathematical constructs. They serve as **symbolic expressions of metaphysical truths and cosmic laws**, revealing hidden patterns underlying existence.

Key numerical archetypes include:

- **Monad (1):** Unity, origin, and the Divine source  
- **Dyad (2):** Duality, polarity, and division  
- **Triad (3):** Harmony, balance, and synthesis  

Within this framework, numbers act as guides to understanding both the **spiritual and material realms**, mirroring the deep interconnectedness between **creation, human consciousness, and divine order**.
