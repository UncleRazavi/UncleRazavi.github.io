Cognitive functions are the control processes of the brain that govern planning, decision-making, problem-solving, and goal attainment. They are vital in learning, adaptation, and navigating everyday life.

One intriguing question is whether the learning of music can actually enhance these cognitive skills. Studies indicate that musical training activates multiple areas of the brain and improves memory, attention, and even spatial skills. Musicians often have stronger connections between areas of the brain, which is argued to improve overall mental flexibility.

But the question isn't as simple as it seems: Are musicians naturally more intelligent, or are their cognitive abilities actually developing through years of musical practice? Research suggests it can go both ways-early musical training may fortify the brain, but at the same time certain innate abilities may make learning music easier.

Whether you're picking up an instrument for the first time or have been playing for years, your brain is likely benefiting in ways that go beyond just making music.
